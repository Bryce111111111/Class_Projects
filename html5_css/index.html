            <h2>Shih tzu lore(without an m)</h2>
            <p>Shih tzu's are known to be "holy Tibetan" dogs. Many say they bear the souls of monks in their small, stout bodies. They were breed to resemle to tibetan god of learnings dog, who was a puppy who could transform into a lion. The word "Shih Tzu" actually translates to little lion. With that cool nickname, and supposedly having the attributes of a lion, they still somehow come out to be the dumbest/clumsiest dogs ever. However even with them being so dumb, they make up for it with their cute actions and traits.</p>

            <h3>Royalty</h3>
            <p>Shih Tzus have a strong historical association with royalty, particularly in China, where they were bred by imperial families and gifted as signs of good wishes. Chinese royalty did not allow the dogs to be traded outside of the noble class until 1930, solidifying their status as royal companions. A strict breeding program was even established by Empress Cixi to create her ideal imperial dog, further cementing their status in royal circles.</p>
