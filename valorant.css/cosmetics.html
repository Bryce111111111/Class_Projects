                <h2>WEAPON SKINS</h2>
                <p>Valorant features a wide variety of weapon skins that let players customize the appearance of their guns. These skins often include unique visual designs, animations, sound effects, and finishers. Skins are released in bundles and can be purchased through the in-game store or earned through battle passes. Some premium skins are highly detailed and themed, ranging from futuristic to fantasy styles. Weapon skins don't affect gameplay but are a big part of Valorant's cosmetic appeal and player expression.</p>
